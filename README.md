# Building recovery online made easy #

### What this is ###

This is an easy way for recovery maintainers or anyone who's interested in building recoveries to finish their dream without a server.

This works with GitHub actions, thank GitHub not me.

### How to use ###

Here are some useful notes to using this tool brewed with black magic.

Some variables that you'd like to set:

```MANIFEST : Link to your recovery manifest, Google it if you don't know what this is```

```DEVICE : Most likely your device codename, e.g. rosy, sakura, curtana, etc.```

```DT_LINK : Link to your recovery device tree.```

```DT_PATH : Path to clone your device tree ```

```KERNEL_LINK : Link to your device kernel source ```

```KERNEL_PATH : Path to clone your kernel tree ```

```TARGET : recoveryimage or bootimage, depending on if your phone has a recovery partition or not ```

If you don't know any of these, **Ask [Google](https://www.google.com) or someone who builds recoveries**, I don't provide TWRP building support.

You'd also like to do edits on your recovery device tree first if your recovery needs that (e.g. SHRP, etc.)
